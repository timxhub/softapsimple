Photon SoftAP implementation to switch d7 LED on/off and flash the RGB LED.

Shows how SoftAP can be used to do 'things' rather than just serve web pages.

Based on the Particle example.

It is strongly recommended that you flash the code using DFU rather than OTA because once this firmware starts running it won't be possible to do OTA programming; thus needing to use DFU to flash subsequent versions of the firmware.
